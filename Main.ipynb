    "Chroma features are widely used in music analysis and processing. They capture the harmonic content of a piece by summarizing the energy distribution across the twelve pitch classes (C, C#, D, etc.) within an octave. This allows for tonal comparisons irrespective of the octave.\n",

    "1. **Frame segmentation:** Divide the audio signal into overlapping frames.\n",

    "3. **Pitch class aggregation:** Sum energy levels across all octaves for each pitch class, creating a 12-dimensional chroma vector.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Tempo refers to the speed or pace of a piece of music, measured in beats per minute (BPM). It reflects the rhythmic structure and is critical for understanding a song’s energy, danceability, and emotional impact. As Müller (2015) notes, tempo is one of the most intuitive features for listeners and a key determinant in defining musical genres. Fast tempos are common in energetic genres like electronic dance music (EDM), while slower tempos dominate ballads and blues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How is tempo calculated?\n",
    "The process of tempo extraction typically involves:\n",
    "1. **Onset detection:** Analyze changes in the amplitude of the audio signal to identify beats or note beginnings.\n",
    "2. **Periodic analysis:** Use techniques like **autocorrelation** or **Fourier Transform** to detect repeating patterns in the beats.\n",
    "3. **Beat frequency estimation:** Measure the time interval between beats and convert it into BPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Estimating Tempo\n",
    "Consider an audio track where beats occur every 0.5 seconds:\n",
    "1. Measure the time interval between beats: \\( T = 0.5 \\, \\text{s} \\).\n",
    "2. Calculate the tempo using the formula:  \n",
    "   $$\\text{BPM} = \\frac{60}{T} = \\frac{60}{0.5} = 120 \\, \\text{BPM}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates the track has a tempo of 120 BPM, which is typical for many pop and dance tracks (Tzanetakis & Cook, 2002).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications and importance\n",
    "- **Genre differentiation:** Tempo is a distinguishing feature in many genres, such as EDM (typically 120–140 BPM) versus ballads (50–70 BPM) (Müller, 2015).\n",
    "- **Music recommendation:** Tracks with similar tempos are often grouped together in playlists for specific activities, like workouts or relaxation (Wikipedia contributors, n.d.-b).\n",
    "- **Rhythmic analysis:** Provides insights into the overall \"feel\" or \"groove\" of a piece, which is essential for understanding its style and energy (Tzanetakis & Cook, 2002)."

    "## 2.2 DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm introduced by Ester et al. (1996). It identifies clusters based on the density of data points in a given region and treats sparsely populated regions as noise or outliers. Unlike centroid-based algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN does not require the number of clusters to be specified beforehand. Instead, it uses two parameters, $\\varepsilon$ (epsilon) and $\\text{minPts}$, to determine cluster structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is particularly suitable for datasets where clusters exhibit irregular shapes and varying densities. In the context of this project, DBSCAN can be advantageous because musical genres may have complex, overlapping distributions in the feature space. Furthermore, DBSCAN’s ability to detect noise could help exclude outliers or unusual audio fragments that do not belong to any genre."

    "#### **Algorithmic Principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN uses the following key concepts to identify clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neighborhood definition:**\n",
    "   For a point \\(p\\), its \\(\\varepsilon\\)-neighborhood is defined as:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   N_{\\varepsilon}(p) = \\{q \\in D \\,|\\, \\|p - q\\| \\leq \\varepsilon\\}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   Here, \\(D\\) represents the dataset, and \\(\\|p - q\\|\\) is the distance between points \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) (commonly Euclidean distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Core points:**\n",
    "   A point \\(p\\) is classified as a core point if it satisfies:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   |N_{\\varepsilon}(p)| \\geq \\text{minPts}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Border points:**\n",
    "   A point \\(p\\) is classified as a border point if it lies within the \\(\\varepsilon\\)-neighborhood of a core point but does not itself satisfy the core point condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Noise points:**\n",
    "   Points that are neither core points nor reachable from any core points are classified as noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cluster formation:**\n",
    "   Clusters are formed by expanding the neighborhoods of core points. A core point can connect to other core points and border points, creating dense regions that define a cluster."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "#### **Algorithm Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Begin with an unvisited point \\(p\\).\n",
    "2. Determine if \\(p\\) is a core point:\n",
    "   - If \\(p\\) is a core point, start a new cluster.\n",
    "   - Include all points within the \\(\\varepsilon\\)-neighborhood of \\(p\\) in the cluster.\n",
    "   - Recursively check all core points in the neighborhood and add their connected points.\n",
    "3. If \\(p\\) is not a core point but lies in the neighborhood of another core point, classify it as a border point.\n",
    "4. If \\(p\\) is neither a core nor a border point, classify it as noise.\n",
    "5. Repeat until all points in the dataset have been visited."

    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- DBSCAN can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes, which is beneficial when analyzing datasets with irregular patterns, such as musical genres.\n",
    "- The algorithm automatically detects noise and excludes it from the clustering process.\n",
    "- There is no need to predefine the number of clusters, making it suitable for exploratory tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- The algorithm is sensitive to the choice of \\(\\varepsilon\\) and \\(\\text{minPts}\\), and inappropriate parameter values can lead to over-clustering or under-clustering.\n",
    "- DBSCAN struggles with datasets that contain clusters of varying densities, as this can affect neighborhood detection."

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN is a suitable algorithm for this project because of its ability to identify clusters of arbitrary shapes and handle noise effectively. Unlike centroid-based methods such as K-Means, DBSCAN does not assume spherical clusters and is well-suited for datasets with irregular patterns (Ester et al., 1996). This flexibility is particularly advantageous when clustering musical genres, as the feature space may exhibit overlapping or complex structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, DBSCAN's robustness against noise allows it to exclude outliers from the clustering process, making it effective for detecting unusual or out-of-distribution audio fragments (Pedregosa et al., 2011). However, the algorithm is sensitive to the choice of its parameters ($\\varepsilon$ and $\\text{minPts}$), which require careful tuning based on the dataset's density distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, DBSCAN remains a strong candidate for exploratory clustering in this project due to its adaptability and lack of reliance on predefined cluster counts. Future steps should include parameter optimization and comparison with other clustering methods to assess its performance comprehensively."
